As a student in the 2000s, I, like most students I knew, had a nokia 3310. A classic phone, virtually
indestructible, the phone had a long battery life, reasonable sound quality, it was the phone of the time.

Beyonds it's classic features, it had games on it, with the now legendary Snake 2.

- While code prevented right and down keystrokes from doubling back, left and up keystrokes would result in gameover.
## solution
- changed code to directly interact at the keystoke entry. This fixed the code.

## bug
- curses.curs_set(0) caused an error in Heroku application
## solution
- no solution, had to remove curses.curs_set() function.
